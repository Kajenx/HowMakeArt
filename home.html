Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
This is my art tutorial site. I hope that after going through these tutorials you will feel comfortable drawing from your imagination 
without the need for references. I know the frustration of looking at professional art and wondering how the artists managed to pull 
complete pictures out of their heads. After many years of struggling, I have come to a place where I feel comfortable drawing realistic figures 
and landscapes without reference, and I believe anyone can use the same formulas that I do to construct imagery with good results.<br/>
<br/>
Here, you will be able to learn, step by step, how to draw people, landscapes, animals, and anything else you might need to create the ideas 
you have in your head. The site is currently a work in progress, so if you follow me on my 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LucasPaakh" title="Follow me on facebook!." target="_blank">facebook page</a>, you can keep track of when I upload 
new material.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and be patient with yourself!<br/>
