<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<br/>
I hope that after going through these tutorials you will feel comfortable drawing from your imagination 
without the need for references. I know the frustration of looking at professional art and wondering how the artists managed to pull 
complete pictures out of their heads. After many years of struggling, I have come to a place where I feel comfortable drawing realistic figures 
and landscapes without reference, and I believe anyone can use the same formulas that I do to construct imagery with good results.<br/>
<br/>
The site is currently a work in progress, so if you follow me on my 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LucasPaakh" title="Follow me on facebook!." target="_blank">facebook page</a>, you can keep track of when I upload 
new material. Good luck, and be patient with yourself!<br/>
