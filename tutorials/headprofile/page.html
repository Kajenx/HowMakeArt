<h1>Drawing the Profile View of the Head</h1>
This method uses a construction similar to the front view. In the next tutorial, we'll see how to put them together to draw the head at an angle.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headprofile/1.jpg" alt="A circle with a cross."/>
Begin the same as the front view.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headprofile/2.jpg" alt="Map in the chin."/>
On this step, it's important to make the vertical line slant inward otherwise the lips and chin will protrude later. Also, be very careful not to make the chin too long! 
It's better to err on the shorter side and make the chin less than one-third the overall height rather than making it too long.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headprofile/3.jpg" alt="The top and back of the head."/>
The skull is longer than it is wide, so the back of the head needs to be pushed out one-fourth the width of the circle. When drawing, it's often helpful to use a series of
straight lines to define a curve, as we do between this step and the next step.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headprofile/4.jpg" alt="Finish the back of the head."/>
You don't need to draw the dotted lines here, but if you imagine it on your own drawing, you can see the head makes a diamond shape. The "peak" of the skull sould be be slightly inward from the back
of the circle.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headprofile/5.jpg" alt="Adding the nose."/>
Use a diagonal to map the inner corner of the brow, and drop the nose from this. The ball of the nose will line up with the bottom of the original construction circle.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headprofile/6.jpg" alt="Finish the nose and start the mouth."/>
Finish the nose with a nostril. The hole in the nostril extends roughly halfway between the nostril and tip ofthe nose; don't make it too big! Draw the upper lip one-third 
the way between the nose and the chin. As before, be careful not to put the mouth too far down.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headprofile/7.jpg" alt="Finish the mouth."/>
Map in the bottom lip and chin using crisscrossing lines. The upper lip, lower lip, and chin are each a third of the space beneath the nose.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headprofile/8.jpg" alt="Detail the eye."/>
A simple formula for an eye is skeched out here. Be sure not to put the eye too high up or too far forward. It should sit halfway between the top of the head and the chin and a bit 
behind the brow. Use the diagonal brow line to guide you.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headprofile/9.jpg" alt="Draw the ear."/>
The ear lines up with the eye and the nose and sits on the line we drew earlied to measue one-fourth of the circle. You can draw the ear with a series of straight lines like we did with the lips and the back 
of the head. The overall shape of the ear mimics the shape of the head. You can use the same formula for the inside of the ear that we used on the forward-facing head.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headprofile/10.jpg" alt="Finish the construction."/>
The jaw drops straight down from the ear halfway to the chin, then diagonals to the tip of the chin. The original horizontal line we drew for the chin defines the fat beneath the jaw, so if your 
character looks a bit fat, you can curve that line upward to make them slimmer. After this, You can follow the diagonal of the jaw upward to define the back of 
the head, then draw the back of the neck angling off from there. The front of the neck protrudes a bit from the midline of the original construction circle.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headprofile/11.jpg" alt="Erase the construction lines and add hair."/>
Now you can erase the construction lines and add hair. The hair will usually recede slightly at the temples, even in women, and bump out before the sideburn.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headprofile/12.jpg" alt="Shading the head."/>
Like before, we'll be going into more depth with shading, but for now, this is a simple map of how to shade with top-down lighting.
<hr/>
	
Next up, we will combine the front and side view to make a the three-quarter turn of the head! Be sure to practice the profile view facing both directions. One direction always seems to need 
more practice than the other.
