<h1>Drawing the Front View of the Head</h1>
This method will probably seem formulaic at first, but once we go through the side view and learn to rotate in various directions, 
I will explain ways to modify the formula to make a woman's face, as well as how to add fat, make it look more childlike, and ways to distort it without 
losing the structure.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headfront/1.jpg" alt="Just a circle."/>
Begin by drawing a circle.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headfront/2.jpg" alt="A circle with a cross."/>
Then draw a cross through it.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headfront/3.jpg" alt="It's looking like an Irish cross now."/>
Extend the cross down half the length of the circle. The midline 
should have three equal parts.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headfront/4.jpg" alt="The outline of a face."/>
Draw a short line at the base of the midline (for the chin) and bring the jaw down 
with two lines on each side to form a clear angle. Make sure the corners of the jaw are low enough (about halfway between the circle and the chin). If you 
draw them too high it looks like an elongated chin with no jaw.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headfront/5.jpg" alt="Adding the nose."/>
Add a small cicle for the ball of the nose and two angular lines to map the inner corner of the brow. The horizontal line we drew earlier will become the brow 
line later, so position the eye-lines below it. Eyes tend to sit about halfway between the chin and the top of the skull. The lower you place the eyes below 
the brow line, the younger the face will appear.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headfront/6.jpg" alt="Place the eyes and mouth."/>
Draw two dots where you want the pupils/iris of the eyes to go. I've found this to be the most accurate way to position the eyes; draw the iris, then draw the lid 
draping around it. Place a line for the mouth one-third of the way between the nose and the chin. Make sure you don't put the mouth too far down; 
this is a common mistake.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headfront/7.jpg" alt="Add the neck and ears."/>
Draw two lines down from the side of the head to make the neck. You can make the neck thinner by tapering it as it goes down, but even very thin people will have 
a neck as wide as their face when viewed from the front. Place the ears so the tips line up with the eye dots, and the bottom lobe lines up with the bottom of the nose. 
A quick shorthand for the inside of the ear is deomonstrated on the side. We will look at ears in more detail later.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headfront/8.jpg" alt="Detail the nose"/>
The nose, viewed from the front, is diamond shaped. You can ceate the complex shape with four simple arcing lines, as shown. When shading, remember the nose is a ball, 
so you start the shadow halfway down. It's a common mistake to shade only below the nose. This will give it a flat, uncanny look.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headfront/9.jpg" alt="Detail the eye."/>
Here is a simple formula for an eye to use for now. We will detail eyes later. In short, remember the eye is rounded, so the lid is draping over it. 
To avoid the egyptian looking eyes that beginners tend to make, keep the bottom of the eye straight. You want most of the curve to happen in the upper lid. 
Keep the inner corner shorter than the outer corner, and keep the line for the upper lid darker than the lower lid (the upper lid has more lashes and will always 
appear darker). Here, I've used a broken line for the bottom lid to keep it indistinct. Finish off with a second line above the lid to mark the crease.
<hr/>

<img src="tutorials/headfront/10.jpg" alt="Finish the construction."/>
Finish the construction of the face by adding brows and hair. I've also added some lines to define the lower lip and the muscles of the neck. When drawing 
hair, remember that it sits above the circle of the skull. You can bring hair up as high as you like and it won't look wrong, but if you make it too flat your 
character will look like they don't have a forehead. Also be careful to place the arch of the brow closer toward the end. The arch is actually the brow following the 
curve of the skull beneath, so it should occur where the brow wraps around the temple.
<hr/>
	
<img src="tutorials/headfront/11.jpg" alt="Shading the head."/>
Now you can erase the construction lines and begin to shade. Shading will be handled in later tutorials, but the middle picture here should help you map out the basic 
planes of the face. The original circle used to construct the head shows where the cheekbones sit, and the arch in the eyebrows hint at where the forhead begins to 
curve. The bridge of the nose, between the eyes, will flatten slightly, making it darker than the forehead and the length of the nose. Lastly, remember the eye is 
rounded, so the top lid will be highlighted and the bottom lid will have a shadow. You can mostly get away with shading just under the inner corner to make it look 
rounded. Too much shading below the eye can make it look like dark circles or eye bags, so be careful. Add a white dot on the same spot of each eye to make them shiny!
<hr/>
	
That's it! My finished drawing deviated slightly from the construction, and that's to be expected. Keep your construction lines light so you can nudge them into 
place as you go. The main problem with drawing from the imagination is that it's hard to visualize something completely and put it on paper that way. The construction 
is just there as a starting point to map things out for you. As we go along, this method should become second nature, and you'll be able to draw a head from any 
angle very quickly.</br>
